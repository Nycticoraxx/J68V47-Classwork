        //Use the '=' operator to assign a value or an expression to a variable.
        //The variable stores data inside itself, e.g. 'int a=10' means 'a' has a value of 10.
        //The rvalue is data that is evaluated to produce new data, that is then stored in the lvalue. E.g., 'int x = 1 + 2;' is
        //evaluated to mean 'int x = 3;'. Then the value '3' is stored in the variable 'x'.
