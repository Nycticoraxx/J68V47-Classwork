//public class means that it can be accessed from any other class or package
//public method ("public static void") also means that it can be accessed from any other class or package
//the same is true for fields,i.e. 'public int value;'
//so 'public' is used to define classes or methods or fields
//the opposite of public in java is 'private'
//A 'class' is data that is put together to preform a function, in this case helloworld is a class used to print text
//that says "Hello and welcome!
//static means that the variables you are creating will remain stored across different classes, it is 'static'/constant
//void that means that there is no return handle,integer,object, or string -it just ends
